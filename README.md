# feedme

feedme is a very basic RSS agregator

Deployment etc instructions to come so for now you'll just need to figure it out

To add a feed go to /admin/add

Once the bottom of an article scrolls onto the screen it's marked as read

**NB: there's no auth on this as I run it on a host only I can access.**
